# RPI_VARIANTS
# This module is meant for retrieving the Raspberry Pi's generation model, PCB model (dimension-wise) and PCB revision
# the official list is https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/revision-codes/README.md
# first inspired from http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/09/checking-your-raspberry-pi-board-version/
# Also check https://elinux.org/RPi_HardwareHistory for missing revision codes.
# Works with Python 3 & 2 !!!

# Each key represents the hardware revision number
# This isn't the same as the RaspberryPi revision
# Having the hardware revision number is useful when working with hardware or software.
