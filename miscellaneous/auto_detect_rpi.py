# For every change brought to this file, don't forget to update its counterpart in DexterOS.

# RPI_VARIANTS was inspired from http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/09/checking-your-raspberry-pi-board-version/
# This module is meant for retrieving the Raspberry Pi's generation model, PCB model (dimension-wise) and PCB revision
# Also check https://elinux.org/RPi_HardwareHistory for missing revision codes.
# Works with Python 3 & 2 !!!

# Each key represents the hardware revision number
# This isn't the same as the RaspberryPi revision
# Having the hardware revision number is useful when working with hardware or software.
